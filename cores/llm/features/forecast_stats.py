# forecast_stats.py
"""Empirical, point-in-time forecast statistics from Prism's own track record.

This module turns the realized outcomes that Prism has accumulated in
``stock_tracking_db.sqlite`` into **honest base rates** for the subscriber-facing
insight image:

  - :func:`get_stock_scenario` — the most recent analysis row for a ticker
    (its own ``target_price`` / ``stop_loss`` / ``buy_score`` / ``trigger_type``).
  - :func:`get_forecast_distribution` — among PAST analyses with a *completed*
    30-day outcome that share this stock's profile (buy-score band, optionally
    the same trigger), what fraction rose / went sideways / fell. Returned with
    the sample size ``n`` and which conditioning *tier* produced it.

Design rules (so the numbers stay defensible):
  - **Point-in-time**: only rows with ``tracking_status='completed'`` (their
    forward window has already elapsed) feed the distribution — never the row
    being rendered. No look-ahead.
  - **Cohort frequency, not a per-stock prophecy.** The caller must label it as
    "stocks Prism picked under these conditions historically resolved like X".
  - **ratio units**: the stored returns are ratios (``-0.42`` == -42%), so the
    ±move threshold is a ratio too (``0.10`` == ±10%).
  - Tiered fallback with a minimum sample floor; the tier is reported so the
    caption can be honest about how specific the cohort is.

Everything is best-effort: any failure returns ``None`` / empty so the image
still renders without the forecast overlay.
