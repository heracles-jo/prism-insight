"""한국투자증권 Open API as a market data source.

The contracted route. KRX restricted the server's IP on 2026-08-04 for automated
bulk collection, and the fix is not gentler scraping — it is asking a provider we
have an agreement with. KIS is that provider, and it is the only one here besides
KRX that publishes investor flows.

Two things shape this adapter:

**It borrows the trading client rather than authenticating on its own.** KIS
issues one token per app key, and `kis_auth` keeps global environment state that
`changeTREnv` mutates under `get_trading_env_lock()`. A second auth path on the
same host would fight the live trading loops for that state and could force a
token re-issue underneath them. `DomesticStockTrading(auto_trading=False)`
already resolves the account, reuses the cached token and takes the lock on every
request, so this reuses it. The flag is false because nothing here places orders.

**The daily chart endpoint caps how many rows one call returns.** A year-long
request comes back truncated with no error, which would quietly chart a shorter
period than asked for. So ranges are walked backwards in windows until the
requested start is reached, rather than trusting a single call.

Imports of the trading package are deferred: it reads `trading/config/kis_devlp.yaml`
at import time and would make this module — and the whole source chain — fail to
load on a host without KIS credentials.
