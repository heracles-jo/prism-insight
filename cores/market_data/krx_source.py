"""KRX Data Marketplace as a market data source.

The richest source available — it is the only one here that publishes investor
flows — and the most fragile. KRX restricts IPs that query in bulk (2026-08-04:
"자동화 수단을 통한 비정상 대량 조회가 감지되어 해당 IP의 접속이 일시적으로
제한되었습니다"), so every call has to be treated as something that may simply
refuse today.

`krx_data_client` is imported lazily. Importing it at module scope would make
this file — and everything that reaches it — fail to load on a host without KRX
credentials, which defeats the point of having alternatives.
